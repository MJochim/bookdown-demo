# Problem

When I insert R code using backticks, but *inside an HTML comment block*, the code is executed upon building:

I expect the following to be executed and show 2: `r 1+1`

(Open the HTML source to see what I mean) I would never expect this to be executed. Inside, the comment, I expect to see a code literal (1+1) instead of the codeâ€™s result (2). <!-- `r 1+1` -->

# Prerequisites

This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

For now, you have to install the development versions of **bookdown** from Github:

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading `#`.

To compile this example to PDF, you need to install XeLaTeX.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
