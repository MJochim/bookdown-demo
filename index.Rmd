# Problem

When I insert R code using backticks, but *inside an HTML comment block*, the code is executed upon building:

I expect the following to be executed and show 2: `r 1+1`

(Open the HTML source to see what I mean) I would never expect this to be executed. Inside, the comment, I expect to see a code literal (1+1) instead of the codeâ€™s result (2). <!-- `r 1+1` -->
